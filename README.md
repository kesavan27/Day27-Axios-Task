# React CRUD Application with Axios

## Overview

This React application allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on user data, utilizing Axios for API requests. The user data is fetched from a mock API: `https://661c07d0e7b95ad7fa698cac.mockapi.io/api/v1/todo`.

## Features

- Add new user records.
